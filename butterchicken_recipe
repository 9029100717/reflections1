Notes

Thickened cream: Also known as whipping cream, thickened cream has a milk fat content of at least 35 per cent and contains a thickening agent such as gelatine or vegetable gum, which makes it easier to whip and less likely to curdle or split when cooked. Use for cake fillings or fold into mousse.

Made this recipe as per instructions and found it be so easy and it was a big hit with the kids.  If your kids don't like chilli you could easily reduce the amount.  Thanks Taste, this will be on rotation for us this winter!

Not sure why other reviewers are complaining about flavour or watery consistency as I have never had this problem and have cooked this quite a few times. I follow the recipe as stated except used ghee instead of the oil, and cayenne pepper instead of chilli. I also have used left over chicken and diced potatoes. It doesn't taste like an authentic restaurant dish, but what do you expect if using pre ground spice and low fat dairy?

I never write reviews and usually, the recipes on taste.com.au are great, but I have to say that this was probably one of the worst dishes i've cooked from this site. There was absolutely no flavour in this that even slightly resembled butter chicken. The chicken itself was tender but the whole dish was just bland and lacked depth of flavour. I allowed the sauce to reduce by cooking it an additional 30mins and the flavour still didn't intensify. I ended up adding 2 tbsp of tomato paste, 1 tbsp of sugar and salt and pepper. Only then was the dish edible.

It's not a really strong curry. I had to double all the dry ingredients and reduce it right down to get a flavour close to anything authentic I've had. Great result though, delicious.

Hi Taste, long time reader, first time reviewer. Signed up so I could remind people to always read the reviews before spending time and money on an online recipe. Had I taken my own advice I would have saved myself bitter disappointment over this recipe. There is no flavour and the gravy is watery AF. The recipe is missing full a body of spices, I think cardamon should be in there, amongst others. Basically, what every other review has suggested.

Really enjoy this recipe. Not huge on taste, but simple and really good for kids/fussy eaters. Make a heap of it and freeze it with some rice.

Agree, not the amount of flavour we're used to from Butter Chicken. But when I looked I to it I found that it often has loads of sugar and that they use a special red colouring agent. Might go some way to explaining it ...

Disappointed, We love butter chicken but this was bland looking and tasting, except for the ginger.
Followed recipe completely. Mine did not look anywhere near as rich in colour or even as thick as the picture depicted.
We won't be eating this tonight :/

I made this dish with great expectations. I am sorry to say the end result was a watery tomato something. Sauce did not thicken even with cream added. Absolutely nothing like butter chicken. Very little flavor. I followed the recipe exactly. So upset with it I think I will throw it out.

It isn't packed full of flavour or anything, extremely simple and easy to make, and I did enjoy but I wouldn't make it again because it is just too mild in flavour :)

Try sprinkling some crushed cumin seeds to dish. Adds more flavour.

Pretty basic, with no real flavour at all. It was kind of like chicken chunks floating in creamy tomato soup. Needs much more flavour.
